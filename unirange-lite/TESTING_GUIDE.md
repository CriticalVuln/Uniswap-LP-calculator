# 🚀 Testing Instructions for UniRange-Lite

## Current Status: ✅ Ready for API Key

Your UniRange-Lite application is **fully functional** and ready to test! The only thing missing is a Graph Protocol API key to fetch real pool data.

## 🔧 What You Have Now

### ✅ Working Features:
- **Beautiful UI**: Modern token-based pool search interface
- **Token Selection**: WETH, USDC, USDT, WBTC dropdowns for all 4 chains
- **Fee Tiers**: 0.05%, 0.3%, 1% selection buttons  
- **Price Inputs**: Human-readable price ranges (e.g., "$1800-$5000")
- **Multi-Chain**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base support
- **Version Toggle**: Uniswap V3/V4 selection
- **Status Indicators**: Shows API key status in the header

### 📱 Development Server:
Running at: **http://localhost:3000**

## 🔑 To Get Real Data:

### 1. Get API Key (5 minutes):
1. Go to: **https://thegraph.com/studio/**
2. Connect any wallet (MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.)
3. Click your profile → "Billing" → "Create API Key"
4. Name it "UniRange-Lite"
5. Copy the API key

### 2. Configure Environment:
```bash
# Create .env.local file in project root
NEXT_PUBLIC_GRAPH_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### 3. Test Everything:
```bash
# Test subgraph connection
npm run test:subgraph

# Should show: "✅ Subgraph connection successful!"
# And list top 5 pools by TVL
```

## 🧪 Testing the App

### Without API Key:
- Pool search shows "Pool not found"
- Header shows "Rate limited (no API key)" 🟠
- UI works perfectly, just no real data

### With API Key:
- Pool search returns real Uniswap pools ✅
- Header shows "Unlimited access" 🟢  
- APR calculations use actual fee growth
- TVL and volume data from subgraphs

## 🎯 Test Scenarios

1. **Select WETH/USDC on Ethereum, 0.3% fee**
   - Should find the largest Uniswap pool
   - Display real TVL (~$500M+) and volume

2. **Try different chains (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base)**
   - Each has working token addresses
   - Multi-chain subgraph support

3. **Price Range Testing**
   - Input realistic ranges like "$1800-$5000" for ETH
   - Watch tick conversion work automatically

4. **V4 Toggle**  
   - V4 shows beta warning and mock data
   - V3 uses real subgraph data

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

- **Clean Separation**: Blockchain, subgraph, cache layers
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and loading states  
- **TypeScript**: Fully typed with no compilation errors
- **Performance**: React Query caching and deduplication
- **Security**: API keys in .env.local (gitignored)

## 🎉 Ready to Scale

Once you have your API key:
- The app becomes a fully functional LP calculator
- All the infrastructure is there for adding more features
- Easy to deploy to Vercel/Netlify with environment variables

**Your foundation is rock-solid! 🏆**
